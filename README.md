BeyBlade GO (the name was of course inspired from Pokemon GO) is a multiplayer augmented reality game, based on the popular anime series BeyBlade. According to Wikipedia, Beyblade is a line of spinning-top toys originally developed by Takara, first released in Japan in July 1999, along with its debut series. There are multiple kinds of BeyBlades, but we'll be having two in this game:

1. **Attack Type:** These Beyblades specialize in attacking other Beyblades. They battle fiercely and try to knock out the other Beyblade as fast as they can, but at the cost of having poor stamina. 
2. **Defense Type:** These Beyblades have more stamina as compared to Attack type Beyblades. They attack less fiercely resulting in less damage to the oppenent. However, they can also withstand the attacks of the opponent much more as compared to Attack type Beyblades.

## 💻 Networking Logic

This game uses Photon PUN for networking. Photon Unity Networking (PUN) is a Unity package for multiplayer games. Flexible matchmaking gets your players into rooms where objects can be synced over the network. The PUN package wraps up three layers of APIs:

👉 The highest level is the PUN code, which implements Unity-specific features like networked objects, RPCs and so on.

👉 The second level contains the logic to work with Photon servers, do matchmaking, callbacks and such. This is the Realtime API.

👉 The lowest level is made up of DLL files, which contain the de/serialization, protocols and such.
